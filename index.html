		<p> Hello, welcome to my website. There are various writings
			that I'm currently planning on completing and uploading here,
			for now the website may not have many pages. </p>
		<p></p>
		<p> Plans for the future: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Anime/LN Commentaries: I break down some interesting
				anime or light novel series and discuss possible author
				intent and opinion shown through various elements of the 
				story. I try, and will try, to do this using what I believe
				to be a likely correct interpretation. That is, I 
				try my hardest to not overly read into what the author says or
				the anime portrays. This will hopefully be more clear with the
				first commentary. </li>
			<li>Five Minutes or Less: I write a short opinion piece that tries
				to raise and prove a certain point in less than five minutes of 
				reading time. These pieces are not subject bound, and I may make
				some that aren't opinion based at all. </li>
			<li>More fun stuff to come...</li>
