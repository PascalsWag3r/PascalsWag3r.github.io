The sun feels different! And the heat feels different!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“This is summeeeeer!”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I screamed with joy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is already autumn in Tokyo, but the scent of summer still lingers in Okinawa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The blue sky and shining sea seemed to hint at the fun times that will come.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As planned, Eri-san rented a car where we all boarded in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the way, we had a chance to try Okinawa Soba (buckwheat noodles), and then we went shopping for groceries.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We stopped at a shopping center, and while pushing the cart, we discussed what we would eat for our future meals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“You can’t go wrong with curry, can you?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I quickly joined in the conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“If that’s the case, can we have it tomorrow afternoon?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Why?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Well, Kuro's tongue is out of this world, so I’d like you to turn it into something that she could eat by tomorrow.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“What the hell does that even mean, out of this world?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I can’t think of any better phrase than that…”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed Eri-san sensed something bad and pulled out easily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Ah,
 yeah, ok. Given the circumstances, I’ll prioritize that thought. That 
makes tomorrow’s lunch curry. What should we do for our dinner today and
 tomorrow?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Onee-chan, we have
 a big group for tomorrow night, so I think something simple would be 
good enough. I’m sure we’ll be pressured by the time rehearsals came 
along.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn’t have any objections to that opinion because it was perfectly legitimate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“How about a barbecue then?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Agree!”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The decision was made, but dinner was still a problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“We’ll just have the leftovers and bread for tomorrow morning, but what about for tonight?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Shall Momo show her skills now? If it’s pasta or something like that, the right amount should be plenty for six people right?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hmmm,
 looking at this group of people, it seems like Maria is the best cook..
 The last time she snuck herself and cooked for me, the food was 
delicious. I can guarantee that she has excellent skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it wasn’t decided smoothly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“You have to study and do the PV at the same time, don’t you? I think it’s too much of a burden.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well,
 yeah, it’s true that Maria has to do both the PV and studying at the 
same time. She may have the ability to do so, but it’s not a good idea 
to rely only on one person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That’s what I thought, but when I was about to agree with Shirokusa—</span></p><p class="c0"><span>“</span><span>Shirokusa-san</span><span class="c1">, are you afraid of Momo’s cooking skills?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“...Huh!?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Maria had a deadly look</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I’m
 sure you’re jealous of Momo, who can do things that you can’t. 
Shirokusa-san must be feeling devastated by her cooking skills and is 
just jealous of Momo. Am I wrong?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Not at all! That’s not true! Not even in the slightest!”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hey there, you two... we don’t have Kuro right now, that’s why... let’s reduce the number of fights...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Since it came to this—”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Eiii—”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“It’s a cooking contest!”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“It’s a cooking competition!”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I sighed and spoke to Tetsuhiko.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“What are we going to do about this?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“You should do something about it, Sueharu.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Do you think I can handle it?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“It’s easy. All you have to is eat whatever comes out of it.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Oi, you think Shiro’s gonna make something weird, don’t you?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“... I’ll pick up your bones when you’re dead.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“... I’ll make sure you eat it too. If I’m going to die, I’m taking you along with me.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I— re—fuse.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“You’re— noi—sy.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I’m gonna kill you! “That’s supposed to be my line!” “Shut the f*ck up and die!” “You’re gonna die too!”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Reina, who was looking at our ugly battle with dismay, looked sideways and shook her body with a loud voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“U-umm… both of you…are scaring me…”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We stopped fighting and turned around to the words of Reina.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“...”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shirokusa was standing there with a terrifying aura around her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why
 aren’t you saying anything? It’s just you’re scary already, but I’m 
getting scared even more okay? If you don’t give me an explanation, I’ll
 start to worry that your cooking skills are really atrocious, and the 
double whammy of intimidation and fear of the bad food that’s about to 
come is going to make it more painful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Hey, hey, hey, you highschool boys! Have some sense of decency!”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eri-san gave me and Tetsuhiko a decapitating blow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tetsuhiko
 would have lost his temper if I did that, but as expected, he felt that
 he should show some courtesy to an older woman. He looked unhappy, but 
didn’t say anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I’m talking about what food to make. Don’t say horrible things about the people who make it.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can’t even gulp when Eri-san said that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I’m sorry.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I apologized earnestly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tetsuhiko didn’t say anything but he made a light bow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“... Thank goodness there was a decent person and I got saved.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Hm? Reina, does that mean we’re not sane?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“What? You don’t think you’re sane, do you?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Reina began to think seriously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“No,
 no, no, that’s not the case, isn’t it? If so, isn’t that alarming? 
Like, really, I’m just saying this out of kindness, but you should be 
aware that you’re not in the right mind to think that way.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Oh~? Doesn’t this mouth say unnecessary things?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I
 pinched her cheeks and stretched them out, and Reina, who had a funny 
look on her face, tapped my waist to declare she gave up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That’s right, kouhais should always stay honest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“If we’re going to have a cooking competition, we should decide on the subject. It’s hard to compare different dishes.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eri-san seemed to be quite enthusiastic about the idea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I
 wanted to secretly pretend that it didn’t happen, but I guess there’s 
no helping it. I think it would be better to choose a menu item that 
would cause the least damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Tetsuhiko, give me a good idea.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Why don’t we do a comparison of local instant noodles?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“You’re usually a scumbag, but sometimes you’re a genius.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“That’s boring.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Geez, I’m being judged by the absolute authority of the leader of the group.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“But I don’t want it to be too difficult to make…”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Then, let’s do karaage—”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shirokusa cuts in to make a suggestion, but her voice was quiet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So before everyone could hear it, it suddenly got filled in by Eri-san’s voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“If that’s the case, how about a hotpot?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We all nodded in agreement to Eri-san’s suggestion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, a catastrophe can be avoided with hot pot. In the meantime, Eri-san seemed to be wary of Shirokusa’s fists.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Isn’t it hot already?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tetsuhiko cursed, but Eri-san didn’t mind at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>“What’s wrong with that? I eat ice cream during winter and </span><span>oden</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;during summer.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“.....”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tetsuhiko seemed to be unable to hide his uneasiness, but he already ran out of energy to argue back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Umm... I think we should do karaage after all—”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Then, it’s decided!”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Eri-san making the final decision, we ended up having a hot pot competition.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After that, we all scattered, and it was shopping time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Kachi-senpai, do you have all the cooking equipment you need?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Eh?
 Ah, yeah! When the chef came around, there was hardly any equipment 
needed to be brought in. It’s a villa that was designed for parties in 
the first place.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Heee— rich people are amazing.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Umm, well, I know that we already decided on hot pot—”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Tetsuhiko, should we buy some ramen just in case?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“That’s a safe bet. Well, we can use it for the worst case scenario.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Oh, they have ramen like this? I’ll buy some as a souvenir.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Onee-chan, ice cream is a must, right?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Uhn—, I’ll leave it to you, Maria.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Oi, Onee-chan! Just how much alcohol are you buying!?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“It’s because I don’t have to drive when we get to the villa. It’s enough for two days, today and tomorrow.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Onee-chan, did you become a little bit wasted when you started going to college?”</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #f9f9f9; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 598.00px; height: 854.00px;"><img alt="" src="v3c2i1.PNG" style="width: 598.00px; height: 854.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><br></br><br></br><p class="c6"><span class="c1">"Sake is an adult taste～. I’m sure you’ll understand in a few years!"</span></p><p class="c0"><span>"Ah, I knew I should’ve cooked something different than hot pot──"</span><span class="c3"> (Pascal: I suppose what’s meant here is that she would put alcohol in her hot pot)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;We were able to choose our items in a friendly atmosphere. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I wonder why shopping when traveling is so much fun. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It wasn’t like I was doing anything special, but I couldn’t stop feeling excited. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">（I wish Kuroha could come from the first day too──）</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I almost thought that in my heart, but I managed to endure it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;……This time, I have decided. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>"Unless Kuroha makes a firm apology for lying to me, I won’t forgive her"──*smash* </span><span class="c3">(Pascal:
 だ is the sound effect for something here but I’m not quite sure what, 
smash seems to make the most sense here. I guess Haru’s hitting the wall
 or something in frustration or resolve)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I asked Aoi for advice and thought a lot about it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;From Aoi’s perspective, Kuroha was lying for an understandable reason. So she asked me to forgive her. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I received the feeling, but can I forgive you？There’s a part of me that thinks so. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;But this is a decision. It’s about whether it makes sense or not. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;If
 I forgive Kuroha, wouldn’t I have to forgive her for everything she’s 
done to me？Even not going to that extreme, there are more logical 
patterns of reasoning like "You forgave me then, so you can forgive me 
this time, too."</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;Maybe I’m being too prescriptive. </span><span class="c3">(Pascal: basically going too hard into making rules)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;But if one lies, the one who lies apologizes. If she apologizes, I forgive her. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I want to do such a natural thing. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;But if I forgive someone trying to cheat me, it will leave a hole in my heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;So I made up my mind to be cautious about Kuroha. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What’s wrong, Sueharu?"</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Tetsuhiko called out to me from behind. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;He held a drink in his hand called Ryukyu Coke. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;You idiot. I’m really worried. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You’re thinking about Shida-chan, right?"</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No──"</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I reacted when he hit the nail on the head. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I immediately understood that I failed. Tetsuhiko was waiting for my reaction. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I can read that quickly enough. Shida-chan and you have had your fights, but you’ve typically made up quickly."</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It’s no different this time."</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Don’t
 act so tough. If the situation is so muddy, even if the cause of the 
fight is the same, the way things end up will be much more messy."</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;As expected of a man who had been through so many rough times. His persuasive power is different. </span><span class="c3">(Pascal: I wanted to put “hits different” so badly)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I looked around. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;……There are no company members near us. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Now──can you hear me?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Hey, Tetsuhiko."</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What?"</span></p><p class="c0"><span>"What would you do if you were in my position?"</span><span class="c3"> (Pascal: Marry Shirokusa obviously)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It might have been a little too abstract. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;But I’m not even sure if the people around me like me. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Anyway, I’m sure Tetsuhiko would know a lot more about my situation and other things than I do. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;So I just threw it out there. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">"If it were me──"</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;After thinking a while, Tetsuhiko said. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I’d make a harem by seducing all the girls around me."</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You’re such a scumbag that I’m actually relieved."</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That’s right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's what I've been told! That's the kind of answer he'd give, I'm sure!</span></p><p class="c0"><span>“Is it okay to divide the scraps……?” </span><span class="c3">(Pascal: you know, like splitting the girls between the two of them. T_T)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tetsuhiko Kai grinned with a devilish smile</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Be
 honest, there are many cute girls around you. Even if you don’t know 
how much they like you, you still know that they hold a certain degree 
of goodwill against you.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“We-Well..”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“If
 so what’s wrong with returning the favor? Common sense? Laws? That kind
 of thing wasn’t there when humanity was born! I’m not telling you to 
hurt her, am I? In fact, what I'm saying is that you should make them 
happy, make EVERYONE happy. What does it matter if something is a little
 out of the ordinary? Isn’t it more important that our precious children
 are happy? In other words, This is ‘Human love’ and ‘Kindness.’ ”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“You’re
 amazing, What kind of demon are you? I'm pretty sure your cause of 
death in your previous life is definitely from a stab from a woman.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Isn’t this what all men want?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I’m afraid I understand a little of what you’re saying.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Having said that, I suddenly felt a presence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">"......! Who's there?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I looked around involuntarily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">...... Thank God, no one is here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because, you know you can't let the girls hear this stupid conversation, can you?</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">＊</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p>
