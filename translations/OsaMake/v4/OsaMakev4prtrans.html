That alone made my eyes doubt what I was seeing, but moreover she was wearing an apron. The apron added to her homely charm. It made it feel like she powered up, as if she&rsquo;d switched from wielding a single sword to two-sword fencing. </span><span class="c6">(Pascal: Swords in both cases referring to single-handed ones)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">I was worried, but her execution was fine. The rhythm of her vegetable cutting was light, and the stir-fried onion&rsquo;s drifting scent simultaneously stimulated my appetite.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">I thought maid-san was in charge of cooking, but it appeared that I was wrong. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Shirokusa&rsquo;s prepared food was omurice. She presented it in front of me, immediately sitting to the right of me. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;Wait, why not across from me instead of next to me?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Look at me, Suu-chan&hellip;&hellip;say &lsquo;aah?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">With beautiful black hair pulled over her ears, Shirokusa held out a spoon with omurice placed on it. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eh?! Ehhh?! No no, Shiro, this is bad&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because Suu-chan, isn&rsquo;t it hard to use your left hand for the spoon?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, that is certainly true&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">My right hand was firmly wrapped in a firm cast. It wasn&rsquo;t impossible to eat with my left hand, but it was hard to do correctly. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Look at me, say &lsquo;aah.&rsquo; &lsquo;Aah&rsquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The sweet, sweet sugary temptation that came from the usual cool-headed Shirokusa. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;My brain melted immediately to the overwhelming sugar, my cheeks loosened, and my mouth opened. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The, then&hellip;&hellip;aah&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;Yes, how is it, delicious?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&#9472;&#9472;Yes! Delicious! Shiro, I&rsquo;ll be honest with you. I thought you could only make fried chicken!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Shirokusa blushed, cooling down her cheeks that became hot with both hands. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, but&hellip;&hellip;I realized it would be fine if I made it according to the recipe, without trying too hard. You can&rsquo;t try too hard at everything, right? It&rsquo;s just as Suu-chan said.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I, I see. I&rsquo;m glad you understand&#9472;&#9472;um&hellip;&hellip;Shiro&hellip;&hellip;your hand is on my thigh&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I wanted you to eat&hellip;&hellip;the food too, but&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But&hellip;&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What I really wanted you to eat was&#9472;&#9472;m-e&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;My blood pressure instantly swung. &nbsp;My head was on the verge of bursting with excitement and agitation. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You, you can&rsquo;t, Shirooo! Maid-san is watching!!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufu, that young woman is at my beck and call&hellip;&hellip;she left a long time ago&hellip;&hellip;so it&rsquo;s just us two here&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What did you sayyy?! You&rsquo;re right! She left before I was aware of it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I shook my head and looked at my surroundings, and the maid-san who came with Shirokusa was not here. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;While I was doing that</span><span class="c0">, Shirokusa drew near with glazed eyes. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Suu-chan, do you want to do naughty things, with me&hellip;&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Na-naughty things, meaning&hellip;&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fufu, you know what I mean&hellip;&hellip;So, you want to&hellip;&hellip;? You don&rsquo;t want to&hellip;&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">She placed her index finger on my thigh, slowly tracing my pants. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It was too pleasant of a soft touch. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The pleasure became electricity and ran through my back, emasculating my body. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Oh, oh no. If I wasn&rsquo;t careful, my body would completely melt&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If, if I had to say&hellip;&hellip;I want to, but&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If I had to say&hellip;&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?!!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Shirokusa snuggled into me. She placed her head on my shoulder. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Her index finger placed on my thigh gently drew circles over and over as if it were behaving like a spoiled child. T</span><span class="c0">he weight and warmth of Shirokusa&rsquo;s head I felt on my shoulder made me realize the fact that I was touching the girl I was attracted to.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ahh&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;My sigh came out. </span><span class="c0">My mind was faint and painful. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;However, the more I breathed in, the more the long black hair gave off its citrus aroma, further accelerating my heartbeat. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey&hellip;&hellip;don&rsquo;t you want to do&hellip;&hellip;naughty things&hellip;&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I, I want to! I want to do it really badly! However&hellip;&hellip;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;However&hellip;&hellip;? You want to, but it&rsquo;s no good?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s no&hellip;&hellip;good&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Enough&hellip;&hellip;talk&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Shirokusa&rsquo;s face was already 10 centimeters in front of me. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It was approaching five centimeters in front of me. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;And immediately zero centimeters in&#9472;&#9472;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That was what I was hoping for, Tetsuhiko.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dude, grooooooooss!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Tetsuhiko&rsquo;s verbal abuse echoed inside the bathroom. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Yes, I was currently encamped in the bathroom at my house and on the phone with Tetsuhiko. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;There was a reason why things became like this. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up! I&rsquo;m saying, I&rsquo;m in the harshness of reality&#9472;&#9472;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay okay, I understand, so go back to the living room. Isn&rsquo;t it weird to stay in the bathroom for too long?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ugh&#9472;&#9472;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Just like that, I was at a loss for words. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;I understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, are you going to thank me for listening to your extremely worthless delusion? A hostess nee-san listens to these gloomy hardships, right? </span><span class="c6">(Pascal: as in, a girl in a &ldquo;bar with female companions for male customers.&rdquo; Hopefully I don&rsquo;t have to say more</span><span class="c0">)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Can you not compare a high schooler to a hostess? Your natural darkness is unnerving me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not worth it unless there is large compensation given, idiot.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;Yes, sorry. Thank you very much for listening&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&#19968;You owe me one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;No, wait a second. You have had experience with this, right? As an experienced person, give me one piece of advice&#9472;&#9472;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;A large sigh. Afterwards, an exasperated-like voice came back. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If it were me, I&rsquo;d take the initiative to &lsquo;discipline&rsquo; them. I&rsquo;d try to do it regardless of whether I could actually pull it off or not. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;What if I don&rsquo;t think I can?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Run away.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;What if I can&rsquo;t run away?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Reluctantly endure it.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;What if I can&rsquo;t endure it?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Die.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;What if I don&rsquo;t want to die?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Pray.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Ah&#12540;okay okay, that&rsquo;s how this is going to end, huh. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll gather your bones. &lsquo;Enjoyed love yourself&rsquo; to your heart&rsquo;s content.&rdquo; </span><span class="c4">(Pascal: This is supposed to be like an obituary I think)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The phone call cut off. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;Haa.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I unconsciously let out a large sigh. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Everything Tetsuhiko said was sound. At least, shutting myself in the restroom wouldn&rsquo;t solve the problem. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&#9472;&#9472;Alright!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I hit my cheeks to get motivated and left the restroom. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;My legs felt heavy as if there was lead inside them. But I mustered all of my strength and returned to the living room. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Haru, you were surprisingly slow.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Suu-chan, does your stomach hurt? Do you need to go to the hospital?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t a certain someone make you eat something bad?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The air was tense. The three lovely girls, who couldn&rsquo;t stop at only being lovely, were emitting auras behind them as if they were accompanied by fiendish beasts watching vigilantly and sharpening their claws. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Yes, this was the reason why I took refuge in the restroom. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I have a stomachache&hellip;&hellip;Let&rsquo;s go to the bathroom again&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Momosaka-san? Could you stop saying that while looking at me? The maid-san over there made the dinner. </span><span class="c1">Isn&rsquo;t that right, Ooragi-san?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;Yes, that is correct, but is there a problem?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The girl wearing the maid outfit indifferently muttered. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Ooragi Shion&#9472;&#9472;appeared to be her name. She was the same age as us. But the rest of the information was currently unclear. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Her face was very well proportioned. </span><span class="c0">But how do I say this&#9472;&#9472;she didn&rsquo;t look like a maid. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Her peculiarity was her drowsy eyes. </span><span class="c0">She had a hairstyle in which her hair was longer from the side to the bangs compared to the back of the head. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">What was bothering me was that her movement was felt strangely quick and energetic. The outcome was that I didn&rsquo;t feel she gave off an intelligent atmosphere. Thanks to that, I couldn&rsquo;t completely grasp her personality. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then who&rsquo;s wrong? When Momo came, Sueharu onii-chan just had a bad complexion?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;T</span><span class="c0">he beautiful imouto who came the latest among them, Maria, said to blame the two who came before her.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Then&#9472;&#9472;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;When we were inside the car and decided to stay overnight, Suu-chan&rsquo;s complexion was good. That means it&rsquo;s decidedly Shida-san&rsquo;s fault.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;A cool beauty novelist with a bit of clumsiness, Shirokusa, asserted. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The simultaneously blamed caring onee-chan childhood friend, Kuroha, shook her trademark clover hair ornament and became furious. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"><img src='/translations/OsaMake/v4/pics/v4i7.jpg' alt='Volume 5 Picture 1'></img></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you saying?!

I&rsquo;m serious!&#65289;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;All three were cute. Extremely cute. Absurdly cute. Each had a different personality, furthermore each was attractive. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I understood that! I was fully aware!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;So I could understand the feelings of a guy who would call the current situation a luxury. </span><span class="c0">If I wasn&rsquo;t a related party, I might say so too. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;But! It&rsquo;s different! </span><span class="c0">I want you to think carefully!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;How about if there was a very cute cat, but it had tiger claws? What would you think if it had a long snake-like tongue? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be scary if it howled like a ferocious wolf?! </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;After all, it was the sweeeet giggles and laughs to make my heart pound that I longed for, right? Looking at this calmly, this was the first city block of hell, wasn&rsquo;t it? It&rsquo;s the escape RTA where I make one mistake and I die, right? </span><span class="c6">(Pascal: RTA = real time attack, basically as if he&rsquo;s speedrunning through an escape sequence and trying not to die)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Oof, my stomach hurts&hellip;&hellip;My lifespan is shortening&hellip;&hellip;Someone save me&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Whether she knew my troubles or not, Maria nodded in response to my words. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s true.

That&rsquo;s fine, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Since Shirokusa was staying, there wasn&rsquo;t a reason for her not to stay. That was Kuroha&rsquo;s argument. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Just be sure to get your parents&rsquo; permission.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Shirokusa&rsquo;s father said to the three of us. Shirokusa wrinkled her brows and brought them together, but Souchirou-san did not take back his words. This neutral position was connected to the trustworthiness of Souchirou-san. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Afterwards, Kuroha contacted her mother, Ginko-san. But Ginko-san didn&rsquo;t answer the phone because she was at work. She had no choice but to explain to her father, Michikane-san, about.the situation. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I think you staying is fine, but that&rsquo;s meaningless without legitimately getting Ginko-san&rsquo;s permission.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;That was the reply. </span><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why Kuroha remained in limbo at my house. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Then, when I finished eating the dinner made by Ooragi-san while in an awkward atmosphere, Maria came from where she heard about this. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I heard Sueharu onii-chan is in a crisis!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Probably everyone has&#9472;&#9472;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&#65288;You coming makes the situation worse&hellip;&hellip;&#65289;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Is what I thought, but I couldn&rsquo;t turn her away when she came with good intentions.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;When I asked her, she said, &ldquo;Eri-san gave permission for me to stay overnight,&rdquo; so I had to let her in&#9472;&#9472;Because of that incident, my stomach hurt, and I shut myself in the bathroom and called Tetsuhiko. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&#9472;&#9472;Ding dong. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;At the sound of the intercom, everyone turned towards the entrance. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;Who?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s possibly&hellip;&hellip;Tetsuhiko?

Though, if I continued to push, it would only turn into an argument, so I could only be exasperated. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;As I sighed, my eyes saw Midori Ao being lightly dressed even though it was fall. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It might not be cold for the very muscular, but her youthful chest and thighs were generously exposed.

I can imagine that what actually happened was that while Eri-san wasn&rsquo;t home, she must have just left a letter and gone out.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Kuroha was the first one to finish her phone call.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Haru, you know what&hellip;My mom said I can&rsquo;t, so I won&rsquo;t be staying over&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see.

Whether something makes sense or whether it&rsquo;s not against common courtesy, she&rsquo;s really paying attention to these kinds of things.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;In that sense, Kuroha&rsquo;s mom, Ginko-san, also is the same. Being a woman with a strong-minded drive and speech and conduct, she&rsquo;s also a decent person valuing logic and etiquette.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Maria kept on saying she&rsquo;d stay and didn&rsquo;t pay attention to what she was told, but she gave in once the cab that Kuroha ordered had arrived.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand.

It seemed like both of them already grew accustomed to dealing with Maria.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Kuroha lived next door, so she was holding out for longer than Maria, but as expected, she got a phone call from her dad Michikane-san telling her to come back home around 10:30 PM.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh~&hellip;U~~~~h!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Groaning, she glared, giving me an up-from-under look.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now, Kuro.

But from another perspective, the midterms scheduled for Tuesday and Friday this week were going to be really bad.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I kept studying since last week, and during the trip I solved all those practice problems prepared for me by Kuroha.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;I see. If you do, then it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Kuroha showed a little sign of relief and nodded. She probably saw through me and realized I was feeling bitter.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Keep on. If something comes up, call me any time. She left such words and proceeded to the front door.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh, wait a minute.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;For some reason, Shirokusa went after Kuroha.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shiro?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s nothing important, wait for me in the living room.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Being told that, there was not much I can reply with.

When exactly did she start standing over there! She&rsquo;s got too small of a presence!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;However, regardless of my astonishment, Ooragi-san did not bulge a bit and showed no reaction whatsoever.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Erm, Ooragi-san? &hellip;&hellip;I guess it&rsquo;s fine if I call you this way? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Ooragi-san took a firm grasp of her maid&rsquo;s outfit skirt, and adding to her sleepy eyes a killing intent, she whispered:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&#9472;&#9472;Could you please stop being so cocky?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;Wha-?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Um, erm&hellip;&hellip;?

It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;d lose anything if I heard her out.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Ooragi-san put up a &ldquo;finally, I won!&rdquo; smug kind of smile, and declared with beaming self-confidence:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The misunderstanding that Shiro-chan loves you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Um, erm, yeah&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I breathed a lot of air in, and slowly blew it out.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I flat out realized just now.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I see, I guess I was starting to think that Shirokusa must have had feelings for me&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;After all, during the trip, we did have a really good thing going on.

That&rsquo;s why the opinions of others had more credibility!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Looking at the foolish behavior of Ooragi-san, it&rsquo;s clear that there were some doubts regarding the credibility of her opinions. But what she&rsquo;s saying was what I was worried about all along&#9472;&#9472;&ldquo;Am I not only being recognized because of past glory?&rdquo;&#9472;&#9472;it matched that perfectly. That&rsquo;s why I couldn&rsquo;t ignore it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;For example, after the re-encounter with Shirokusa, I couldn&rsquo;t think even of a single instance when I gallantly managed to help her. Well, I did help her with her inability to prepare stew, but it wasn&rsquo;t a big deal. I just happened to be there, and if one was around, it was something one would normally do anyway.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;As for Maria, she did use words like &ldquo;as a wife&hellip;&rdquo; but since these words were being used in such a natural way, it sounded more like a joke. How should I put it&hellip;a joke that can be told precisely because of our sibling-like relationship?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Regarding Kuroha&#9472;&#9472;I seriously dunno. I&rsquo;m the one one-sidedly being taken care of. It&rsquo;s fun to be together, but from Kuroha&rsquo;s point of view, would she gain anything from dating me? Above all, I got dumped after I was thinking that we had a thing going on&hellip;&hellip;She did say she loved me, but since there was no basis to it, it felt like I was being toyed with.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;O, Ooragi-san&hellip;&hellip;What you just said, what is the basis for that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Basis? No, it&rsquo;s all truth? Oh, there was too much truth laid out in front of you and now you can&rsquo;t face reality, eh? &hellip;&hellip;Oh no, I was being too much of a genius.

From her annoying words, I could feel that it was in her nature.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;But there was some charm to her as well, and this made it hard for me to react. Like how she&rsquo;s singing her own praises about being a genius all of a sudden. Or how she usually used polite language, but how it </span><span class="c0">changed once she starts talking to herself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Hmm, I more or less grasped what kind of person she was, but I couldn&rsquo;t imagine myself being friendly with her. What a pain in the a**&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;While I was thinking about these things, Shirokusa came back.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;? What happened?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It looked like Shirokusa felt the strange air that was present between us.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Ooragi-san whispered as if nothing happened.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nothing really?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mou, the way you put it, I know it&rsquo;s your habit that shows while you&rsquo;re lying.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not telling you any lies&#12540;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Shirokusa sighed slightly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Suu-chan, Shion is like a younger sister to me. She has a slightly impulsive side to her, but she&rsquo;s a really good girl.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shiro-chan, I&rsquo;m the older sister!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, yes, you are.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The way in which she&rsquo;s impulsive didn&rsquo;t look to be &ldquo;slight&rdquo;&hellip;But I guess it&rsquo;s fine.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The problem was whether what Ooragi-san had been saying was the truth or not.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Respect and love were different things. Don&rsquo;t misunderstand one for the other.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;These words themselves sounded convincing enough. And since Shirokusa called Ooragi-san a &ldquo;younger sister-like girl&rdquo;, there was no doubt that they were close to one another. Therefore, it&rsquo;s natural to think that she understood the subtleties of Shirokusa&rsquo;s heart.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;But&hellip;&hellip;if this indeed is the case, then&hellip;&hellip;I don&rsquo;t want to admit it, but&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;ugh&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;ooof&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shiro-chan, the bath is about to get ready, how about you take a bath?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah.

I&rsquo;ll clean everything up in order to prepare it for you, Shiro-chan. While I&rsquo;m doing that, Maru-san, it&rsquo;s okay for me to replace the boiling water, isn&rsquo;t it? Because it&rsquo;s unbearably disgusting to submerge into the water you used before us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is so painful&hellip;&hellip;!

After all, aren&rsquo;t all men beasts?&rdquo; </span><span class="c6">(Pascal: Bad flag. Bad flag. At least maid-san is an idiot.)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Extreme as always, Shion, aren&rsquo;t you. But don&rsquo;t say such cruel things to Suu-chan. That is a request from me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;If Shiro-chan says so, then I&rsquo;ll think about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;She&rsquo;d only think about it and wouldn&rsquo;t listen to what she&rsquo;s being told. I was pretty sure of it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It looked like Shirokusa noticed this too, but it seemed like she wouldn&rsquo;t be emphasizing this point. It felt as if she had pointed it out multiple times, but there was no improvement regardless.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;This girl didn&rsquo;t look like she would listen to warnings.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, Suu-chan. If you&rsquo;re going in first, wait a minute. I&rsquo;ll change into something that can get wet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&rdquo;?!&rdquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Ooragi-san and I opened our eyes wide.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip; Shiro-chan, what&rsquo;s that supposed to mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean by &ldquo;what that supposed to mean&rdquo;&hellip;Suu-chan can&rsquo;t use one hand of his, so I&rsquo;m about to wash his back. Is it weird?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;My voice was heavy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;We involuntarily started turned to each other, and after mutual glaring&hellip;&hellip;simultaneously turned away.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shiro-chan, it&rsquo;s dangerous, so stop. Maru-san is the kind of person that if he were to wash Shiro-chan&rsquo;s back, he&rsquo;d be like, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ma pour water on you to make your outfit transparent, har har har!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s painful that somehow it&rsquo;s specific, and there is something to what you&rsquo;re saying!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Apart from that, I think he&rsquo;ll concentrate all his nerves on the spots you&rsquo;re touching and will try to enjoy it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Hey, you know what, just at times like this, could you stop saying things as if you&rsquo;re seeing through what people are thinking? I&rsquo;m troubled because it&rsquo;s hard to deny this, you know?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;Um, okay. I can get inside myself, so I&rsquo;m gonna be fine&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Since I didn&rsquo;t want to reveal any more perverted feelings, this was the only thing I could answer with.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you sure you&rsquo;ll gonna be fine?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Shirokusa looked at me worriedly. I surfaced a bitter smile.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I did get in by myself yesterday, it&rsquo;s inconvenient, but I&rsquo;m telling you, I&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case, after all, I should&#9472;&#9472;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t, Shiro-chan! It&rsquo;s too dangerous! If it&rsquo;s come this far, then let me wash his back! With a scourer!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;His back will die!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s scary, because if it&rsquo;s this girl, she might seriously go through with it...</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;All in all, Ooragi-san&rsquo;s interference was too extreme, and I ended up getting inside alone.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Shirokusa seemed dissatisfied with the result and sighed deeply.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mou, with Shion, once it&rsquo;s about Suu-chan, she always becomes so harsh.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;Hmm? Always? Meaning, even before we met, she hated me? Why?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Suu-chan has a naughty side to him, but he&rsquo;s not the type of person that would do mean stuff.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Having said this, Shirokusa turned to me with a beaming smile.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The direct affection that she would not show to our classmates.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I fervently chanted &ldquo;do not misunderstand&rdquo; to myself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;(If it was like that, then Shirokusa&rsquo;s smile was so painful to watch&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I noticed there was still some of the &ldquo;first love&rsquo;s poison&rdquo; left inside me.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;These feelings would not be rewarded. Because &ldquo;love&rdquo; and &ldquo;respect&rdquo; were far away.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The mind understood. But the heart did not work by the mind.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;If this much direct affection was pointed toward me, I&rsquo;d misunderstand, whether I liked it or not.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It was this much more&#9472;&#9472;painful.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;With me being like this, knowingly or not, Shirokusa pulled her black hair over her ears and gently whispered into my ears.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, I&rsquo;ll be under your care from today on, Suu-chan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;Cute.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;My first love came to my own house&#9472;&#9472;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;There was a good vibe in the air, and she talked sweetly to me&#9472;&#9472;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Even so, life did not go on smoothly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I sighed, having predicted that there would be a battle with reason held late at night.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&#65290;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I got out of the bath and peeked at Sueharu&rsquo;s room through my own room&rsquo;s window.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The light was on, but there were no people in sight. On the first floor, the lights were still on. Even though it was past 11:30 PM, it seemed they were still inside the living room.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Slowly but steadily, my hands were sweating. Anxiety made my heart beat faster and deprived me of proper thinking.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shida-san, you seemed to have thought that being next door neighbors was an advantage but&hellip;that&rsquo;s too bad, isn&rsquo;t it? I can be closer than you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Words fired by Shirokusa just as I was leaving flashed into my head.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Be closer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The destructive power of this one phrase was much larger than I could have ever imagined.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I thought I would be closer than anyone else. I thought this would never change.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The position of being a childhood friend was becoming unstable. I also thought this was the case.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;(This is really bad&hellip;&hellip;)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I knew that after the trip, Sueharu shortened the mental distance toward Shirokusa.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;(Haru&rsquo;s attitude toward Kachi-san, that&rsquo;s surely&hellip;&hellip;)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I clenched my back teeth and shook my head in denial.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I needed to make a comeback. If I did nothing, I would become distant from being fulfilled in love.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Get your brain fully operational. What do you had to do, what you mustn&rsquo;t do, you needed to decide calmly. First, you needed to reverse the situation of Shirokusa staying over at Sueharu&rsquo;s house. You needed to leave pride aside for the time being.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&#9472;&#9472;It may be that now was the time to make a move.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Objectively speaking, the more I thought about it, the more difficult the situation seemed. That was how much I was cornered.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">In a certain sense, it&rsquo;s much worse than before rejecting the confession.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">If I didn&rsquo;t make a move now, it&rsquo;s really</span><span class="c1">&#9472;&#9472;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">For no special reason, I took the photo album off the shelf and stopped browsing after having encountered a certain photo.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The photo from the grade school graduation ceremony.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The place was in front of my house. But Sueharu had dark circles under his eyes and was looking sideways.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;This sulky vibe. It was something that Sueharu showed after having de facto retired from the entertainment industry and only when things weren&rsquo;t going well.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;(&#9472;&#9472;That&rsquo;s right. At that time, there was definitely a special bond between Haru and me.)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The memories of mutually seeking and needing each other.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Now, time had passed, and it might not be as easily felt.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;In case of which, I want to remember again. I want him to remember again.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The state of first love might be undergoing a change along time passing by.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;But there were also things that did not change.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The feeling of love. And the pain inside my chest. I was pretty sure these wouldn&rsquo;t change from now on, either.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;Oh.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Suddenly, I came up with something.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It was the second best plan but&#9472;&#9472;with this, I wouldn&rsquo;t lose.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;If that&rsquo;s the case, I could interfere with confidence.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;First, let&rsquo;s do something about living under one roof with Kachi-san. I wanted to thwart this soon.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Now I wanted a pretext. A pretext good enough to make a move.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;But even if the best possible stage is set, I couldn&rsquo;t see the result after all.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;But I should have a better chance than last time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I did have some anxiety. But it&rsquo;s impossible to obtain a big result without any challenge.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Stupid Sueharu. Even though I want you to confess&hellip;&hellip;Don&rsquo;t give up after a single attempt, you, you!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I attacked the Sueharu inside the picture with her index finger.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even if I say so, it&rsquo;s too convenient for me after all, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Surfacing a bitter smile, I reflected on this, closed the album and put it back on the shelf.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;And in the next moment, my eyes were already focused on the battle taking place from tomorrow.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">Pascal: Hi everything, long time no interaction. I have been dying in school since 2022 started. I also basically fell out with the tl I had planned to take over the series because he more or less never did anything (like 1/14th) of this that I ended up redoing anyway). I think that was like around the new year, but this prologue was so darn long that I didn&rsquo;t really feel motivated to post before I went back to school. Lo and behold, someone called dulce_de_leche emails me saying he&rsquo;s interested in translating this series. And he actually seems to know what he&rsquo;s doing AND can go pretty fast. So ya. I&rsquo;ll be editing and publishing this series like I used to be as long as he continues to translate. Make sure to thank him cus I&rsquo;m not really the one doing the heavy lifting here. Also join the <a style="color: turquoise;" href="https://discord.com/invite/nPW8S5nwQH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pascal's Wurld Discord </a> if you want. Expect relatively consistent releases from now on. I also noticed that some grammar and other errors were slipping through when that wouldn't have happened before, so please tell me if anything is off or doesn't work. </span></p><br></br><button onclick="window.location.href='/translations/osamake.html';">Back to Main OsaMake Page</button><button onclick="window.location.href='/translations.html';">Back to Main Translation Page</button>
