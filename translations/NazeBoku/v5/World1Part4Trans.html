Now that they were gone, only the sound of insects echoed slightly. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;Sigh.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;Urza Government Palace, Fifth Floor&#9472;&#9472;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;In the lighted commander&rsquo;s office, Jeanne sighed exhaustedly. She sat down in the center of the round table and bit her back teeth. </span></p><p class="c3"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&hellip;&hellip;It still had to be Farin after all. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;She shouldn&rsquo;t change her complexion in this situation. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Jeanne-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hu, hurry and run please!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Calm down.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;He strongly admonished his two men, who were holding their guns in fear, and sighed heavily again. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m busy. I&rsquo;ve been busy handing work over to the officers who will be staying when we go to Western Schultz. What can I do for you now?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;Have you taken up the hobby of disguising yourself as a human, devil?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s important to practice?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;In the center of the office&#9472;&#9472;</span></p><p class="c3"><span>&nbsp;Illuminated by the light of the ceiling, there stood a girl with </span><span>glossy black hair</span><span class="c0">. Jeanne knew that her appearance was human-like, but was a devil&rsquo;s transformation. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;Succubus Princess Hinemarill. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;In the daytime, she was disguised in civilian clothes, but this time she was wearing the battle garments of the Urza Humanity Rebellion Resistance. This devil had disguised herself as a mercenary to get in here. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I changed my appearance with an application of the illusory enchantment. I wanted to try to deceive humans with this.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did it bother you that Kai saw through you during the day?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s why I had to be more serious. I decided to change my clothes as well as the amount of perfume.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span>&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;The clothes taken from my subordinate.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so scared. They&rsquo;re getting a little sleep outside this building. So don&rsquo;t be scared like that, okay boys?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;Succubus Princess Hinemarill who had turned into a mercenary soldier of the Humanity Rebellion Resistance, winked to men who stood besides Jeanne. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;And took a step forward. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;From the center of the room to the commander standing in the back. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;D, don&rsquo;t come closer!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;Succubus Princess Hinemarill did not stop. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;In front of Jeanne who sat in a chair. To a distance such that this devil&rsquo;s hand could touch her. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This distance&#9472;&#9472;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;The devil reached out her hand. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;The purple claws touched the surface of Jeanne&rsquo;s armor. She looked down happily as the surface of the amor melted slightly, making a sizzling noise. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I eliminated body odor with human perfume. If I&rsquo;m dressed in mercenary clothes, I&rsquo;ll look just like one of your men. So I&rsquo;m sure we can get close to this distance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;Jeanne took a breath. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;She understood now. What this Succubus Princess Hinemarill was aiming for. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you understand?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;A surprise attack on the cryptids?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good answer. Ideally this would be Rath=IE, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s someone else. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;In the form of a low-profile soldier of the Humanity Rebellion Resistance&#9472;&#9472;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;Her true identity was a hero-class devil. It must be impossible for even Rath=IE to guess, if he was confused by hundreds of soldiers. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Devils will also move to defeat the cryptids. Are those devils you?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;Through the edge of the black-haired girl&rsquo;s lifted lips, her thin fangs peeked out slightly. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been ordered to do so. Didn&rsquo;t I say that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;By who?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see. That&rsquo;s not alway good news for humans.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;And Succubus Princess Hinemarill turned away. </span></p><p class="c3"><span>&ldquo;I hope you have a fun trip. </span><span>Ah, and while you&rsquo;re at it, prepare some clothes for me. </span><span>These clothes is too tight in the chest for me, even if the size is perfect.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span><br></span><span class="c7">(TL: Hi everyone, short end to World 1 so I was able to get it knocked out quickly. I do have a lot of school stuff to get through until the end of next Tuesday, so I can&rsquo;t really say how much progress I&rsquo;ll have made on World 2 Part 1 by then, nor do I know how long World 2 Part 1 is. I do post my schedule, or at least expected dates for my next releases in my discord, so if you&rsquo;re interested in joining, just look at the translations page by hitting the &ldquo;Back to Translations Page&rdquo; button or something. Also sorry if there are some typos in the last two parts, I did not do an editing readover as I have a lot of stuff to do. So I figured it was just better to post this now as opposed to like two weeks from now since it was so short anyway. Also I was too lazy to take out the sentences I wanted to check back later, so those are in as well.)</span></p><div class="c6"><p class="c4"><a href="#cmnt_ref1" id="cmnt1"><br></br>[a]</a><span class="c0">(TL: In consideration of &ldquo;It had to be Farin after all&rdquo; mentioned above and the fact that Farin is the only notable female soldier besides Jeanne in the Urza Humanity Rebellion Resistance, this should be referencing her being illusioned by Hinemarill or something.
