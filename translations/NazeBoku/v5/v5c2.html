If one turned to look at the horizon, one could see a green sea of clouds that could be called a thick, spread out forest. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It should have been that. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with that forest, every trees&rsquo; leaves are all black&hellip;&hellip;tree disease? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s those devils&rsquo; forest, isn&rsquo;t it? &nbsp;What, Kai, you not being aware is surprising.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Inside the car&#9472;&#9472;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;in the back seat of a military vehicle on the highway, Reirin muttered. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what happens when the devils&rsquo; miasma sticks like that. That way of dyeing is, from my impression, most likely decades old.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;I&rsquo;ve never seen the real thing before. That is, that degree of black.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s most likely the magical beast&rsquo;s nest. Devils do not live inside that forest, if anything, they prefer buildings similar to human structures. That is something you are knowledgeable in.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;I see.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;After Dark Empress Vanessa ran over the imperial capital Urzak, the property she chose to be her home was none other than Urza government palace. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the time when the generation of trees changes. After another three hundred or four hundred years, that forest&rsquo;s trees will themselves transform into black trees that release miasma. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;If that&rsquo;s the case?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>I don&rsquo;t care.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;That&rsquo;s what the forest chose.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Contrary to Kai&rsquo;s expectations, the elf shrine maiden&rsquo;s way of speaking was cool. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The same goes for the Elf Forest. It&rsquo;s a form of coexistence, but also the result of the sidhes planting and growing many trees&rsquo; seeds that are good for them. That forest is the same. It became a good living place for devils and magical beasts. Because of that, the trees will not die.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a little unexpected.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Surely talking about things like the devil&rsquo;s forest should be hard to stomach for you. It&rsquo;s an enemy race&rsquo;s forest. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it that when the forest&rsquo;s vegetation composition changes, natural things exist?</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If the devil&rsquo;s miasma changed the forest to desert, then that wouldn&rsquo;t be the case. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, you don&rsquo;t mind that black forest?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t disavow the forest itself. But the simple problem is in that situation, swarms of magical beasts started to live in that forest. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Spinning around, Reirin&rsquo;s words became rough as if they were meant to be thrown away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;She took a glance at the rearview mirror. Seeing the huge beast reflected there, the elf clicked her tongue in displeasure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rinne, how are the circumstances?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;Mm. It hasn&rsquo;t transformed since a short while ago. It&rsquo;s been running next to Jeannya&rsquo;s car the whole time.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose your focus. If that huge thing approaches from behind, this kind of small car will be flattened.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;The monster with the outward appearance of a rhinoceros, the &ldquo;Jabberwock.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Although it was a demon with large magic power, due to its resemblance to a magical beast, it was often called that instead. It made earth tremors and was running parallel to the Urza Humanity Rebellion Resistance&rsquo;s vehicle. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think Jeanne doesn&rsquo;t feel like living &hellip;&hellip;Neither do I&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The first car was driven by Kai. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Behind it were five more cars. Twenty mercenary soldiers, including Jeanne, were on board, but the Jabberwock was running alongside Commander Jeanne&rsquo;s car. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;If&#9472;&#9472;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The car slipped horizontally and turned the steering wheel, or the magical beast approached, the two would collide for sure. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;No, if anything the car would be one-sidedly flattened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;You find the viewing experience behind us humans to be detestable</span><span>.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Having said that, running ahead would be like a lackey. So you want to run besides us? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;This liar. Taking the trouble to run alongside humans was to intimidate&#9472;&#9472;that was the human side&rsquo;s feelings. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&#9472;&#9472;I&rsquo;m Kai. Report from the first car.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Picked up the correspondence device. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no change ahead. It seems like magical beasts live in the forest, but there have been no appearances so far. We will continue traveling.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Commander Jeanne&rsquo;s voice. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Jeanne, I want to hear one thing.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The situation of the magical beast running alongside us? I&rsquo;m already used to it running just beside me. If anything, the animal stench is more troublesome than the huge body. If we weren&rsquo;t moving, I&rsquo;d open the trunk and wear a gas mask.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;That&rsquo;s a disaster. By the way, who is that person?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who knows? He or she should still be on the back of the magical beast.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Just at the moment of that conversation &#9472;&#9472;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The roof of the vehicle Kai and the others were on made a thumping</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span>sound, which elevated to a loud scream. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Above?! No way&hellip;&hellip;Rinne, Reirin, watch the top!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The sunroof slid open fully from the driver&rsquo;s seat. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The bright blue sky was the first visible thing&#9472;&#9472;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My, did you open that just for me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Giggles and suspiciously smiling lips. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Although they were backlit, the limbs that flaunted the excessively conspicuous twin hills of the chest forcibly drew Kai&rsquo;s eyes to it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My, what&rsquo;s with that expression that makes you look like you want to say something?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re jumping on a human vehicle, at least say something. The sunroof will be hard to fix if it breaks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even if I told you the sound of the wind would make it inaudible?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There is an elf and Rinne here. They&rsquo;re guaranteed to hear you well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, that is right.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;From the sunroof of the car driving on the highway, the young female demon motionlessly turned her gaze to the car. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Rinne and Reirin were in the back seats. And the Succubus Princess Hinemarill&rsquo;s aim was to decide to sit in the empty passenger seat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve discovered a good pla&#12540;ce.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh!? Wait, you devil, what are you doing?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Darn it&#9472;&#9472;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It was too late when Rinne shouted with a shocked expression. The devil gallantly slid into the seat by Kai. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The seat next to Kai is mine!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t you sitting in the seat behind him?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Th&hellip;&hellip;that, the back seat is wide and comfortable, so I was just a bit distant!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s cramped.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;In the seat next to him&#9472;&#9472;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;Kai&rsquo;s arm holding the handle was slowly entwined with both of Succubus Lord Hinemarill&rsquo;s supple arms. </span><span>She stuck it to her skin, carefully, bewitchingly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp;Furthermore, she came in closer to hold it against her chest. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;The more narrow it is, the more useful it is to stick together. Isn&rsquo;t that right, human? </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Put your seatbelt on.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The devil&rsquo;s hand that was touching Kai&rsquo;s cheek stopped. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;You never know when a sudden brake will happen. </span><span>It would be bad if the steel machine broke through and crawled up through this highway. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Boring.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Hinemarill breathed out a big sigh. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And this &lsquo;mess.&rsquo; Your hand, separate it.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;Don&rsquo;t touch Kai.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m trying to pull my hand back. Your animal strength is interfering.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Rinne&rsquo;s hand was constraining the Succubus Lord&rsquo;s wrist. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The two gazes clashed fiercely in silence, and Rinne moved away first. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;</span><span>I understood completely, but it was just like Rinne. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;She was reliable in not being afraid of staring down a hero-level demon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Then I could guess. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The power between the two was about the same. Otherwise, Hinemarill would assuredly overrun Rinne by sheer force because of the devil&rsquo;s nature. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It was troublesome enough to hesitate, &nbsp;each one cautious of the other. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is Reirin okay?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you saying. An elf shrine maiden like me has no reason for me to be afraid of this kind of small devil! </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, small devil, or rather, hero-class &hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even so.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s the sidhe&rsquo;s pride. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;In front of the enemy race, rather than folding her arms in an ordinary way, the elf folded her arms in a more dignified manner than usual. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s obvious that this kind of half naked devil&rsquo;s intellect is inferior.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;The elf who has a thin body also has poor things to say.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with a flat chest?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;Yes&#12540;I get it, I get it. Reirin, be quiet too.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Inside the car, the three girls were having a staring contest. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It was a strange sight that all except Kai were different races. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; I got on the car for a change of pace, but&#9472;&#9472;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Hinemarill crossed her knees in the passenger seat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This car doesn&rsquo;t have a good view. Most of the sound outside is inaudible.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind if you returned to the back of the magical beast right now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that cold. There&rsquo;s a charming succubus next to you. Well whatever, I&rsquo;ll take my time with the seduction&hellip;&hellip;&#12301;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The devil girl&rsquo;s hand reached out. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Her fingers grabbed Kai&rsquo;s communicator from the driver&rsquo;s seat in no time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H, hey?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Humans have conversations with this, don&rsquo;t they? I know from the slaves who carried these too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The humans in the imperial capital Urzak were enslaved. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;This was because Underworld Empress Vanessa, also known as the strongest succubus, brainwashed many thousands of humans and put them under her control. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;Did the devils learn how to use this machine? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is convenient. It doesn&rsquo;t use magic, so the elves and holy ghosts can&rsquo;t sense it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The devil happily touched the communications device. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Kai&rsquo;s eyes opened more and more as he saw that kind of dexterity. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to make it myself, but it&rsquo;s fun to use machines made by humans. It&rsquo;s very interesting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you planning on doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;He&#12540;re. Can you hear me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Currently, Kai&rsquo;s communicator could only talk with the Humanity Rebellion Resistance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The first to connect was&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hinemarill?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the car right now. I&rsquo;m next to Kai, borrowing the machine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;And?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I want you to change your direction a little &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t talk with such a scary voice. Even though things appear this way, I&rsquo;m saying this for the good of you all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;She took a sidelong glance at Kai, who continued to drive. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The Succubus Lord&rsquo;s claw pointed to the devil&rsquo;s forest overlooking the highway. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Soon there will be the first magical beast nest. There are about three of them scattered around this area.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There are two kinds of magical beasts. The obedient and not-so-obedient ones.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The ones ahead are?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course the latter. They are very territorial and will probably attack the moment it sees a human car. If you find that unpleasant, change your course right away. You can get to the national border of the West without driving straight on the road, do you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The pathless road. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;This desolate ground would mercilessly wear away at the tires. Even if we could pass through safely, there was no doubt the tires&rsquo; lifespan would decrease. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Even so, the devil was saying we should push on. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;I understand. We&rsquo;ll avoid the magical beasts&rsquo; nests. All cars, as you heard.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The Holy Knight of Light complied bitterly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Kai, </span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m sorry, but can I ask you to continue as the lead car? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive safely.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;He turned the steering wheel sharply. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The asphalt pavement gave way to the hard cracked ground. The tires rotating at high speed sent pebbles flying up into the air. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whoa whoa, Kai! Drive more courteously!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am driving courteously. It&rsquo;s the ground that&rsquo;s not courteous.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;If I lost focus, the steering wheel would go out of my hands. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;While avoiding the large grounds protruding out of the ground, Kai stole a glance at the Succubus Lord sitting next to him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;She was used to cars. Her calm cross-legged appearance was very different from the fluster of Rinne and Reirin when they first boarded. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;It is becoming increasingly off of the canonical history&rsquo;s record. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;There was no record of devils being able to use human machines without difficulty. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Is this also the influence of the world reincarnation?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not only the sixth position &ldquo;Steel Machine,&rdquo; but also the five races that may be undergoing changes that deviated from the canonical history. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Come </span><span>on</span><span class="c1">. I&rsquo;m always fickle. All devils are fickle.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Hinemarill played with the communicator, rolling it around in her palm. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>I can think of a lot of smart options.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;But I&rsquo;m not satisfied with those. Although when I get to think like that&#9472;&#9472;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;She turned around. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m more intelligent than the sidhe and impure crossbreed there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;What?! </span><span>The barbaric race head talks so arrogantly!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! And yet the devils immediately get angry and attack with magic!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;Disagreeable. At first, Reirin said, &ldquo;How can I talk to a human?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;Rinne attacked me, who had helped her. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Are you in a position to talk?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Next to Kai, who swallowed his inner thoughts&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, I forgot.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Before Kai could react, the devil girl opened the door vigorously. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The car was driving at great speed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey?! It&rsquo;s dangerous&#9472;&#9472;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leave.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;A roar that shook the atmosphere. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The magical beast Jabberwock, which was running alongside the car, screamed towards the sky. It started running backwards with the momentum gouging the hard ground. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Does that mean you don&rsquo;t need a companion?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that soon we&rsquo;ll be crossing the magical beast&rsquo;s territory. Humans also have kings and nobles who determine their territories.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve heard that. </span><span>Does each devil have its own territory?&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;But there are some things that made sense. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Although they were devils, the huge bodies of magical beasts could not enter the habitat of, say, a small devil imp, which had a small body. As for the sidhes, the elves lived in the forests. The angels were able to live separately in the sky. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh&#12540;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Rinne was the one who responded with a disgusted voice. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that place another devil&rsquo;s territory?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you asking me this? I don&rsquo;t owe you an answer, but the answer is of course, yes. If they see this car, they might come.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I beg your pardon.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It was unlikely that they&rsquo;d attack us now that the Succubus Lord was here, but being surrounded by a horde of demons was never going to be a good feeling. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The ancient devils are curious. I told them not to attack us, but I didn&rsquo;t tell them not to gather. It&rsquo;s rare to see a moving human car, and I think they&rsquo;ll be curious to see it.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;Watch all you want. No more than that.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You better hope that happens.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;But&#9472;&#9472;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;No matter how far we went, there was no sign of a demon horde appearing in front of the Humanity Rebellion Resistance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, no sign of them?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait, succubus, did you lie to us?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;That&rsquo;s strange. Did something happen?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Hinemarill stood up. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; Even though the car was moving, she opened the car door again and moved her upper body out of the car. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the Succubus Lord and I&rsquo;m coming here? It&rsquo;s hard to imagine that not even one of them is there to greet me.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The timing coincided perfectly with the murmur. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;On the pathless road. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;A gunshot echoed. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tch, what?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;In this wilderness? Who was aiming for whom? </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Kai&rsquo;s doubts were blown away by the sight of the Succubus Lord spilling blood and bending backwards. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Bleeding? Was it a serious injury? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Before he checked anything, Kai only bellowed,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hinemarill!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Deja vu. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The sight of Jeanne&rsquo;s armor being shot and Rinne&rsquo;s wings being pierced came to mind. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Steel machine race&#9472;&#9472;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Those mechanical lifeforms were monsters with a gun structure built into each of their bodies. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s them!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;While trying to control the steering wheel with one hand, he desperately reached out. Kai grabbed the shoulder of the Succubus Lord, who was just barely able to stay in the car. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Attack!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;He shouted into the communicator above his knees. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;There was no time to wait for a reply from Jeanne, so Kai only continued to speak in a one-sided manner. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a steel machine! If you stop your car, you&rsquo;ll be shot. Keep driving!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Earth and sand were blowing up. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;A cloud of dust rose up that blocked the route of the car, and I could definitely see a dark gray huge body crawling up from the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hinemarill, are you conscious?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The Succubus Lord was holding her shoulder. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;With all my might, I was trying to pull her back into the car as she was about to far out the car with her upper body slumping&#9472;&#9472;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Kai&rsquo;s hand was brushed away by none other than the devil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;Don&rsquo;t get carried away, fool!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The devil howled. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;A</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;charming smile reflecting the intent for massacring appeared on the lips of the Succubus Lord, who was bleeding from her forehead. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&#9472;&#9472;It&rsquo;s a thousand years too early for steel to kill me!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The devil jumped out of the car. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>While she held left hand over her forehead, which was covered in black blood, Kai saw a crimson glow reminiscent of purgatory in her right hand. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Turn everything to dust!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Bomb blast. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;And then the ground turned upside down. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The earth and sand the steel machine was just about to emerge from was obliterated, and millions of fireballs dyed the air red.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is bad?! The flames are approaching us&hellip;&hellip;Rinne!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wa, wait a bit. What are you doing, succubus!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;Rinne</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;jumped out of the car and thrust her hands towards the void. The swelling flames of the explosion were pushed by the invisible magic and shut off. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The flames were extinguished just before Kai&rsquo;s car was burnt. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh&rsquo;, what, succubus?! What were you doing?! It was about to reach us&#9472;&#9472;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s escaping. Stop the car.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The cars suddenly stopped. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Six military vehicles stopped away from the flames. From there, the mercenary soldiers holding guns jumped out one after another. And when they saw the wounds of the Succubus Lord, they screamed a little. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jeanne, who came running from behind, also frowned at the devil&rsquo;s forehead. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is the wound on the head&hellip;&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm? I&rsquo;m not worried at all. I thought it was about time it attacked. It was annoying that it went through my miasma.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Hinemarill threw a piece of steel. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The fragments that were caught in Kai&rsquo;s palm crumbled into pieces. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The bullet aimed at Hinemarill had already deteriorated sharply by the time it touched the miasma. Therefore, the Succubus Lord was at most only hit by pebbles. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;It didn&rsquo;t matter how injured she was. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;She felt humiliated that she was still injured even after defending herself with the miasma. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And the steel machine?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I let it get away. You&rsquo;ll understand when you look.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The commander Jeanne, who was looking around, and Hinemarill, who was talking next to her, said to each other. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;You can see it dived into the ground just before the technique was activated. I was going to rip </span><span>the ground apart, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;You think it dove like a mole?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That steel seems to be able to dive through the earth like swimming in water. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s escaped to the end of the horizon by now. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a speed that exceeded the expectations of the Succubus Lord. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The speed at which it dove underground was extremely fast, and it escaped the direct hit of the magic technique in the nick of time. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;Tch.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The devil girl took her hand off of her forehead. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The wounds that should have been caused by the bullets had closed up nicely. There were only a few bullet holes left, but they would soon disappear. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahh. It&rsquo;s been about fifty years since I had a scar on my face.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hinemarill, you just said you couldn&rsquo;t find your subordinates. The ancient demons that are territorial haven&rsquo;t shown up. That&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm? That&rsquo;s a problem. I don&rsquo;t want that stranger to take my territory.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The Succubus Lord put her hand to her lips and appeared to be thinking. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey humans. I wonder if that guy has appeared somewhere on the horizon now. Since there are so many of you, you should at least make yourselves useful.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re searching. My men are looking around.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jeanne responded quickly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Given the persistence that it had attacked with in the Devil&rsquo;s Graveyard, it was hard to imagine that the steel machine had completely escaped. The reason it went underground was to avoid the magic of the Succubus Lord. We should be prepared for it to come back to the surface. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;Hinemarill herself was more cautious than anyone else. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;</span><span>She didn&rsquo;t say it directly, &nbsp;but she acknowledged the steel machine as a powerful enemy. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Kai held the Drake Nail. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Rinne and Reirin, who were standing next to each other, hadn&rsquo;t said a word since the beginning because their senses had been sharpened to detect the counterattack of the steel machine. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;But&#9472;&#9472;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;No matter how long we waited, the steel machine that lurked in the ground did not appear. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rinne, you have a keen sense of smell, don&rsquo;t you? Do you smell it?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, not at all. I can&rsquo;t hear any sound from the ground.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Me too. I don&rsquo;t see any sign of approach at all.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Reirin knelt down on the ground. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It seemed that she was searching for the sound with her ears close to the ground, but there seemed to be no doubt even with the elf&rsquo;s hearing. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm. Either it was wary of me, or it went to call its friends&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? What&rsquo;s there to be wary of with a chest as small as yours?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You bastard&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The Succubus and the elf glared at each other. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;And then. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Jeanne-sama!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Five human soldiers who were walking around the perimeter to investigate returned. The soldier at the end of the line was holding a huge bag with both hands. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that the wreckage of the steel machine?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;N, no&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The mercenary opened the mouth of the bag that was tied up. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;What slipped out of the upside-down bag wasn&rsquo;t a piece of steel. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is what we discovered.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Softly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It was a single feather that fell to the ground. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&#9472;&#9472;It was a golden feather larger than Kai&rsquo;s height. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;What?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;What was this huge feather? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Kai wasn&rsquo;t the only one who forgot his words and stared at it. The commander Jeanne and his twenty men were all stunned and unable to move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a feather. No matter how you look at it.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Reirin stroked the feather that had fallen to the ground. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Cryptid race? But I don&rsquo;t know of an individual with such flashy feathers.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;I agree too.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Bending down next to the elf shrine maiden, Kai touched the golden feather with his fingertips. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The surface was smooth as silk, but the fibers of the hairs that made up the feathers were terrifyingly hard. I think even bullets would get repelled by them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;Were the feathers this big? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;If it was, how big was the body? This person is the size of a cryptid. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I felt a burning sensation in my chest.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t just the steel machines. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;There was still some kind of tremendous monster in the immediate vicinity. Everyone felt that way. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Everyone, let&rsquo;s start make a fresh start soon, but&#9472;&#9472;&#12301;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jeanne looked up at the sky. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;She made sure she didn&rsquo;t see anything in the bright blue sky. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The enemy does not always appear from the ground. Always open the sunroof and keep an eye on the sky!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The mercenaries turned around. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;No one collected the feather that had fallen to the ground. The trunk of the car was full of cargo. There was no room for anything else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kai, are we leaving too?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. I want to collect this feather and examine it if I could, but it can&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;He pulled on his Drake Nail and turned away. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rinne, Hinemerill, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ye-s!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;</span><span>Sadly, I&rsquo;ve been aching for so long, but now it&rsquo;s over?</span><span class="c1">&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Despite being wounded, the devil girl slumped her shoulders as if regretting the interruption of the fight. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t just overflow with fighting spirit and then be done. </span><span>I</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;like being teased, but I don&rsquo;t like being rushed.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s far from the end.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Kai got into the driver&rsquo;s seat and held a map of the Federation in his hands. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t even crossed the northern border of Urza. Everything starts from here. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It was far off the planned highway. The current location that I have determined is only a guess, so we&rsquo;ll have no choice but to take a pathless road from here. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hinemarill, will the ancient demon territory continue for a while?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but it seems like the territory has been devastated. Your map is also old, so why don&rsquo;t we just proceed appropriately?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do our best to proceed appropriately. We want to choose the route that is even 1% safe. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Humans are so serious&hellip;&hellip;Ah, but. By the way.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;A bold smile floated to Hinemarill&rsquo;s lips. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I just want to make sure you know, human, that there is a place that was discovered by the ancient demons a long time ago. I wonder what it is.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;What is that place?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Was that human-made? I was curious as to why the devils would build such a cryptic thing in secret from us.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The devil girl leaned forward, as if to show off her ample cleavage. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Pointing with jet black nails&#9472;&#9472;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It was a point on the map in Kai&rsquo;s hand, right on the border between Northern Urza and Western Schultz. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s right in front of the border. I&rsquo;ll show you the way.&rdquo; <br><br></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"><br></br><br></br>TL: I totally botched the &ldquo;the more narrow it is&rdquo; line from the illustrations, but in my defense, I couldn&rsquo;t get a good read on what it meant from the picture. Anyway, sorry for not posting for a while, I&rsquo;ve been trying to focus my efforts on learning Japanese. I had thought that I&rsquo;d be able to get through these translations at a somewhat reasonable pace, but it&rsquo;s still taking way too long. As it stands, I&rsquo;m likely going to not post much for the next six months while I concentrate on studying Japanese in school, but will hopefully resume posting as frequently as I did last year from April to July during this summer. I just feel like my time is not really well used when I rush through these translations, so I want to invest some more time to make sure I can do a better job in the future. </span></p><div class="c7"><p class="c6"></p></div></body></html>
