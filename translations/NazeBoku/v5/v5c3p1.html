<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Undine’s tears──</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The
 far off sacred mountain’s melted snow eventually became a large river 
going towards the west part of the continent. If someone kept driving 
through this wilderness for a few hours, he or she would reach the 
natural border. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;In front of their eyes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Right
 now, the Humanity Rebellion Resistance stopped their cars, and stared 
in shocked awe at the scenery in front of their eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“What is this……”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jeanne’s mutter was not pointed at any of her commanded soldiers. It was nothing but her own feelings spilling out. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“……Isn’t it just like paradise?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;There was space right in the center of the cracked wilderness. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The green grass made one want to run barefoot. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>In the large trees with abundant fresh leaves, there were various colored fruits that were ripening.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;A flock of small birds gathered there, and butterflies perched on the flowers. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;There was no existence of a conflict among living things──</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>What a calm and peaceful place. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Amaーzing.” Hey Kai, this fruit has a really sweet smell.” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Wait,
 Rinne. This is the place that the Succubus Lord wanted to bring us 
along to. It smells sweet, but this fruit might be poisonous. Don’t 
carelessly take it into your hands──”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Delicious.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span>“Listen to my words?!……ugh. Well certainly, this is a wonderful fruit.” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Rinne and Reirin bit into the red fruit. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>It
 looked like an apple but contained much more water and had a sweet 
scent that enticed the mercenaries to look up at the fruit in envy. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“The air isn’t dusty, and it’s comfortable just to lie down. I’m pleased with it! Hey Jeanne, I’m staying here today!”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Here? But that’s different from the plans……”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“If
 we drove all night to the national border, it’d become night. Rather 
than being discovered and chased by cryptids in the middle of the night,
 wouldn’t it be better to wait here until morning?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I agree too~”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Rinne and Reirin laid down on the green carpet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;While looking down at those two people and thinking “good grief,” Jeanne exchanged looks with his close aide. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“General Gregory.” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Yes sir.” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“What do you think? Should we rest here overnight?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“The
 most important matter that should be taken care of is Western Schultz’s
 situation. The small correspondence devices we have installed in our 
cars can’t make contact with Western Schultz. If the signals connect, it
 will be after crossing the border of Western Schultz.” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It was an extremely exemplary answer from a military officer. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Kai
 and the others’ immediate objective was to immediately return to 
Western Schultz and join Commander Balmung and the others. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Isn’t the main principle to cross the national border immediately?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Yes.
 But there are still two days to spare. The eight days presented by 
Jeanne-sama, even though it was something thought of in the moment 
there, was a superb schedule.” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Personnel selection and preparation in three days. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Leaving Urzak no later than the morning of the fourth day. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;That happened the day before yesterday. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>“We
 have time to spend the night here. Crossing the national border 
tomorrow and joining the Western Schultz Alliance tomorrow is not an 
unreasonable </span><span>schedule</span><span class="c1">. However, until this place is confirmed to be safe, I want you to please wait. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;A green sanctuary──</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Like a visible oasis in a desert, it was a pleasant space prepared in a dull wilderness. </span><span class="c1">The experienced mercenaries recognized that this was a potential trap. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Please
 wait until my subordinates have finished searching. To begin with, this
 place was specified by the devil. What on earth could this be?” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Hmm? You have so little trust in me?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;With a flap. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;A
 bewitching devil embraced General Gregory from behind and pushed her 
plump chest against his back. Both wings spread out, enveloping General 
Gregory and not allowing him to leave. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Captain!”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Tch! Le, let me go!”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Good answer. Don’t believe what the devil says. That’s a good way of thinking.” &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“──Hinemarill!”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Wow,
 scary. You don’t have to worry like that, but I’m not just touching 
this person. It’s fine because there’s a proper procedure for succubi to
 suck life force. It’s still fine.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;With slender arms with unreasonable strength put into it, the devil embraced the general and didn’t let go. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;In front of Jeanne’s eyes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;From this view, it was no different than the devil capturing a hostage. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>“You don’t believe me. </span><span>That’s
 the right thing to do. But if I see that to the point of hostility in 
full display in your eyes, don’t you think I’ll become displeased?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“……Guh?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The general’s face contorted. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It was from the chills from being embraced by the succubus and his cutting remarks being pointed out. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Did
 you guys think I’d round all of you up by seducing each of you? 
&nbsp;Idiots, if I wanted to do that, I would’ve bombed the imperial 
capital from the sky at the beginning.” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">「…………」</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“There are no devil’s traps. Understood?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“……Understood.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jeanne responded with a sigh on behalf of the captain who had turned pale.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“That’s enough, Hinemarill. I trust that this isn’t a devil’s trap. Or would you prefer the general’s words instead of mine?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I’m glad you understand.” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The devil girl had a smile across her entire face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;As soon as she suddenly let go of the captain, she already lost interest and didn’t even look at him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>“Ah, even though I won’t do anything, the steel race might be lurking. If you’re scared, do be careful </span><span class="c3">there</span><span>? </span><span class="c1">──Enough of that, uhh, Tai. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“It’s Kai.” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Ah, that’s right. It’s bothersome to remember human names. Come here.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The Succubus Princess beckoned. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>“The human I hugged earlier gave me the worst feeling. Is there anyone out there who will take it gently?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“.............”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Ah, are you ignoring me?” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“In
 any case, there’s something inside, isn’t there? Instead of making fun 
of me, show me the way, because unlike you, this is my first time at 
this place.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“…………”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“What?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The devil girl stared at me. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Was
 her silence an indication of anger? It wasn’t. This Succubus Princess’ 
fiery eyes were brightening as if she discovered something interesting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“You’re strange. I’m used to talking to you.” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Hm?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“You reply to me as if you were talking to a human.” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“……I see. I wasn’t aware because I was used to talking to other races.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span>“I know. </span><span>That unaware way of familiar talking is what I’m talking about.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You’re a really weird human. With────”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Mixed race Rinne and sidhe Reirin. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Looking at the girls following Kai, the devil girl smiled in an unusual way of being lost for words. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;She could not understand. She seemed to say that by shrugging her shoulders. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;──With other races accompanying you, are you planning on becoming the king of the world?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Those words──</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Succubus Princess Hinemarill’s voice reached only Kai and the two people behind him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“……………………”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“What’s wrong, you have a stupid expression. That’s unusual for you.” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I didn’t know how to reply.” </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Kai was at a loss for an answer and looked up at the sky.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“……King of the world, huh?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>I hadn’t talked to this Succubus Princess about my past yet.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;She should only know me to the degree of the human who defeated Underworld Empress Vanessa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;King of the world──</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The irony was overflowing, any more and it’d be a pretentious title. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Hinemarill.” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“What?” </span></p><p class="c0"><span>“I’m
 not a human from this world. No one here remembers me, and the Human 
Resistance Army treated me like a suspcious person at first. That’s why I
 can’t be king.” </span></p><p class="c0"><span>“Huh?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;This time, it was Hinemarill’s turn to look stupid. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;But she immediately stiffed her expression and squinted her eyes suspiciously. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Are
 you trying to provoke me by saying that kind of cryptic thing? I like 
making fun of other races but hate being made fun of. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Then try listening to what Jeanne says. I’m not making fun of you.” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“…………”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“If
 you want to hear more details, we can talk about it more tomorrow while
 traveling. More importantly, this is the place you brought us along to.
 At least lead the way. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“……You’re keeping me in suspense. Well, it’s fine. I did say this was the place I wanted to come to.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Many slightly elevated trees surrounded the green paradise──</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Hinemarill went forward with a familiar look on her face towards the interior. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;……But was there a place like this in the Urza Federation?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;……I never heard about it in the canonical history. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;A
 place born in the alternate history’s world? Even so, it was amazing 
that a lively green paradise existed in this much surrounding roug land.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“The ancient demons discovered this place, but there are no demons here?” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I
 don’t have an interest in this pseudoforest. I thought I said a while 
earlier, what I’m concerned about is that building the humans built.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Building?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“A multistory building without doors. I don’t know the minor details.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;To the end of the fruit-bearing trees──</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;While
 hearing small birds chirp, they crossed the orchard-like forest. 
Suddenly, the field of vision became clearer than before, a stone 
building covered in green moss towered over its surroundings. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Huh?!”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Rinne’s voice squeaked. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Huh……Wh, what is this?! Hey, perfectly level elf, what’s going on?!” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“That’s my line.” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The elf shrine maiden made a swallowing sound with her throat. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“……Don’t tell me. The ruins in the elf forest are here……!”</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;The megalith. </span><span class="c5 c3">(TL: Literal kanji trans is “Unanalyzed God Ruins”- 未解析神造遺跡)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;A huge rock ruin made by processing large rocks into blocks. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;Similarly
 to the Graveyard, it is said to be ancient, but no one knew who built 
it. But at least Kai knew what these ruins were for. </span><span class="c5 c3">(TL: Referencing Devil’s/Demon’s Graveyard)</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I am a being from the world where the Five Races War ended.” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Asurasoraka.

 because it was a territory dominated by the devils, it must have been 
standing quiet for hundreds of years without humans knowing about it. </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;……</span><span>The Elf Forest’s Megalith was the prayer child Asurasoraka’s temple. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;……Then what was this place? Another prophetic god’s?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;This
 world’s “Sid,” the King of the Mercenaries, Arcane Sid Collateral, 
hinted that there were other prophetic gods other than the prayer child.
 </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“So, how about it. Humans should be able to understand it, right?:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Hinemarill,
 we also don’t know anything about these ruins. The only thing I can say
 is that there was a similar thing in the Io Federation.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It resembled that. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;However, Kai would not be sure if he was asked if they were the same thing. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Honestly, I want to know.” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“But only humans or sidhes would build this eccentricity. Elf, what about you?” </span></p><p class="c0"><span>“The sidhes do not use such stones.” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The elf shrine maiden touched the huge rock covered with moss.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“But
 I don’t think humans could build it. Look at it, succubus, these ruins 
have no stone joints. This huge stone would be difficult for even 
dwarves to process.

 Hello I am back after a hiatus. School didn’t break me, and now I’m 
feeling better so I’m starting to work on these translations again. I 
probably will not post again for this series until at least mid-August, 
but I will be aiming for consistent releases afterwards. I envision this
 next year being easier for me to work on translations even in school. 
Anyway join the Discord if you want updates, also I’m picking up a new
