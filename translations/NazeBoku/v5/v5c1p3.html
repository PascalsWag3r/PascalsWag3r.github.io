Where is this? The smell of devils is everywhere.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with all of these ruins? Is this also a human city?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Rinne and Reirin looked around the abandoned building. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Beckoning the two who followed with curious expressions, Kai continued along the paved road overgrown with weeds. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Asphalt crushed by magical beasts. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;There was a huge crater where the trees used to be, and windows of the buildings were shattered without a trace. It looked like an apocalyptic scene. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kai, what is that building? It&rsquo;s really big.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;It&rsquo;s the main station terminal. It doesn&rsquo;t work anymore, but there was a base where vehicles called trains, which were many times larger than cars, would come and go.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The Ninth Main Station Terminal. It was the place I was before when the world reincarnation happened.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It was unrecognizable. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;There was an intersection here. The last sight Kai saw in the canonical history&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Executing the &lsquo;overwrite&rsquo; of the world&#9472;&#9472;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The intersection where I was walking with Jeanne on the way to shopping. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Everything in front of me was sucked into a dark spot in the sky. And when I noticed, I was standing here alone. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard about the world reincarnation from you too&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The elf shrine maiden walked lazily down the cracked road. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know no matter how many times I ask. I understand you aren&rsquo;t lying, but it doesn&rsquo;t make sense that the Five Races War ended with a human victory. And I don&rsquo;t know how it got overturned.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Jeanne said the same thing.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Even humans&#9472;&#9472;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;Even Jeanne, a female childhood friend, was skeptical. </span><span>There was no way an elf of another race could honestly accept it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Since this is a good opportunity, let me ask you in-depth. In the first place, who caused the world reincarnation, and how? And for what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I told you earlier, I don&rsquo;t know the answer to the second part of the question either.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You think you know the first part?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rath=IE said who caused it. You also heard, Reirin.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The Great Founder tampered with fate.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You were also looking for the cause of the world reincarnation, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The Great Founder&hellip;&hellip;or something like that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I only know the name. I don&rsquo;t really know what kind of person the ancestor is, what his purpose is, and how he brought about the world reincarnation. What about Reirin? Sidhes live much longer than humans.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If there were such suspicious people, they&rsquo;d have already launched an all-out attack long ago. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;In the words of Rath=IE. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&#9472;&#9472;The Great Founder is the ruler behind the scenes of history. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Not even the sidhes know his true identity. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Of course, I didn&rsquo;t know as well. I knew almost all of the records of the Five Races war left by the Human Protection Agency, but I couldn&rsquo;t think of anyone who was the Great Founder. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You said Rinne didn&rsquo;t know either, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;ve never heard of him or her either.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Rinne looked up at the broken buildings. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I remember from when we were still fighting the Five Races War. But I&hellip;&hellip;was alone until I fought Dark Empress Vanessa, so I&rsquo;m not familiar with that at all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;Sorry. I can&rsquo;t help at all.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No. Rinne&rsquo;s &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo; is valuable testimony.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The world reincarnation happened in the canonical history. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;If that&rsquo;s the case, then the &ldquo;Great Founder tampering with fate&rdquo; must have also been an event in the canonical history. In other words, the Great Founder existed in the canonical history. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The clue was the Prophet Sid of the canonical history. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;Sid predicted that world reincarnation would occur. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;If the world reincarnation was the work of the Great Founder, then Sid must have known the Great Founder. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;But. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;There was no Prophet Sid in this world. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kai, are we going to end up fighting that Rath=IE?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m planning on it. The steel machines too, even if we don&rsquo;t want to be attacked by them, we will be attacked by them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Cooperating with the Humanity Rebellion Resistance in this world&#9472;&#9472;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;When I made my decision, my goal of defeating Rath=IE had not changed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The west is being attacked, so let&rsquo;s focus on battling the cryptids first. About the Great Founder&hellip;&hellip;we still don&rsquo;t know anything about him or her after all.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mhm. I&rsquo;m also here to avenge Heavenly Lord Alfreyja&rsquo;s death. It&rsquo;s the cryptids first.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The elf turned around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;To the west where the sun was setting&#9472;&#9472;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Next time, I&rsquo;ll really get into it with Rath=IE.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; </span></p><br></br><button onclick="window.location.href='/translations/nazeboku.html';">Back to Main Naze Page</button><button onclick="window.location.href='/translations.html';">Back to Main Translation Page</button></body></html>
