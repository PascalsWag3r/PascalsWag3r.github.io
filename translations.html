		<p> Welcome to the initial (and hopefully to be updated) translations page. </p>
		<p> Here I post my partially MTL-assisted translations of novels that have not been updated for a while or maybe not translated at all. </p>
		<p> I highly encourage you to consider supporting <a style="color: turquoise;" href="/supportjpauthors.html" target="_blank"> the authors</a>. 
		    Even if you don't have the means to buy every JP LN/manga raw or EN official translation that you read, at the very least please consider supporting the authors of series that you do enjoy reading.  
		    Fan translation services are provided for free (or at least, should be), so I do not think it is too much to ask for people to spend anywhere from a few bucks to hundreds of dollars to do this. </p>
